# Hyper Company Angular Bootcamp

## Overview

Welcome to my project repository for the Angular Bootcamp hosted by Hyper Company. This bootcamp is a comprehensive journey through the world of modern web development, covering everything from basic HTML and CSS to advanced Angular frameworks. Throughout this bootcamp, I'm excited to share my progress and learning experiences.

## Technologies

- **HTML & CSS**: Starting with the basics, I'm diving into the fundamental building blocks of web development, focusing on HTML5 and modern CSS practices, including the use of Tailwind CSS for responsive and elegant design.

- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Progressing to scripting, I'm learning JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages. Further, I'm exploring TypeScript for more robust and type-safe code, which is particularly beneficial in Angular development.

- **Angular**: The culmination of this bootcamp is learning Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic and scalable web applications. I'm looking forward to mastering Angular's components, services, and modules to create sophisticated user interfaces and single-page applications.

## Bootcamp Journey

- **Week 1**: Focused on HTML and CSS, understanding the basics of webpage structure and styling. Integrated Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive designs.
- **Week 2**: Delved into JavaScript fundamentals, understanding variables, functions.


## Capstone Project - Upcoming

As of now, we are in the initial phase of the Angular Bootcamp at Hyper Company, currently in the first week of the program. The capstone project, which will be a detailed and modern one-page website, is planned for the later stages of this bootcamp.

## Reflections

### Week 1: HTML & CSS - Smooth Sailing and a Tailwind Challenge

The first week of the Angular Bootcamp at Hyper Company has been both exciting and challenging. We started with the fundamentals of web development, focusing on HTML and CSS. I felt quite comfortable with these technologies, as they are the building blocks of web design and I had some prior experience with them.

However, the real challenge came when we started working with Tailwind CSS. This was my first time using Tailwind, and adapting to its utility-first approach was initially a bit daunting. Despite the initial struggle, I found that Tailwind CSS offers a powerful and efficient way to style websites. It was a learning curve, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to expand my skill set with this modern framework.

Overall, this week has been a valuable learning experience. I am continuously improving and looking forward to diving deeper into more advanced topics in the coming weeks.

### Week 2: JavaScript & TypeScript - A New Language and a New Challenge
